During my internship at Codsoft, I successfully completed three tasks that demonstrate my skills in software development and problem-solving.

## Task 1: Basic Calculator

The first task involved creating a basic calculator application. This application allows users to perform fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Task 2: Password Generator

For the second task, I developed a password generator utility. This tool generates secure passwords based on specified criteria, ensuring strong password strength.

## Task 3: To-Do List Application

The third task involved creating a to-do list application to manage tasks and activities. This application allows users to add, remove, and update tasks as well as mark them as completed.
